/**
 * Thrown when attempting to build a protocol message that is missing required
 * fields.  This is a {@code RuntimeException} because it normally represents
 * a programming error:  it happens when some code which constructs a message
 * fails to set all the fields.  {@code parseFrom()} methods <b>do not</b>
 * throw this; they throw an {@link InvalidProtocolBufferException} if
 * required fields are missing, because it is not a programming error to
 * receive an incomplete message.  In other words,
 * {@code UninitializedMessageException} should never be thrown by correct
 * code, but {@code InvalidProtocolBufferException} might be.
